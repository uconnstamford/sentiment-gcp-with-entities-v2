Line: SolarCity commands a significant 41% share of the residential solar installation market, and the company also operates in the commercial and utilities space.

Line: However, the model has put a burden on the company to constantly raise capital from investors to cover the upfront cost of installing the leased solar systems. Following its purchase by Tesla late last year and owing to the solar market dynamics, the company has moved on to allow consumers to take out loans and own their solar arrays outright. It now puts SolarCity in line with practices of other industry players.

Line: Along with the incentive, the bill proclaims tax credits for homeowners using clean energy.  The Solar Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”), which is considered to be the most effective mechanism to boost solar adoption, has increased from 26% to 30% until 2033, thus making it more affordable for consumers. The energy storage division also gets a boost under the current IRA by including the ITC of 30% for standalone storage projects.

Line: Such an incentive is likely to propel the demand for solar-based energy as consumers fight against rising utility bills. That said, the government would deploy 950 million solar panels and 2,300 grid-scale battery plants to power homes, businesses and communities with clean energy by 2030.
