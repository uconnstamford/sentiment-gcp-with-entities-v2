Line: SolarCity commands a significant 41% share of the residential solar installation market, and the company also operates in the commercial and utilities space. The company's business model of offering to lease solar panels with no upfront costs has helped it gain a big slice of the residential solar market in the past."

Line: However, the model has put a burden on the company to constantly raise capital from investors to cover the upfront cost of installing the leased solar systems. Following its purchase by Tesla late last year and owing to the solar market dynamics, the company has moved on to allow consumers to take out loans and own their solar arrays outright. It now puts SolarCity in line with practices of other industry players.

Line: The renewable energy industry has been growing ever since the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). To fight the ongoing climate crisis and strengthen the U.S. energy infrastructure, the IRA entails an investment of $369 billion over the next 10 years. This Climate Bill, which is part of IRA, is estimated to reduce the country’s carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030.

Line: Along with the incentive, the bill proclaims tax credits for homeowners using clean energy.  The Solar Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”), which is considered to be the most effective mechanism to boost solar adoption, has increased from 26% to 30% until 2033, thus making it more affordable for consumers. The energy storage division also gets a boost under the current IRA by including the ITC of 30% for standalone storage projects.
